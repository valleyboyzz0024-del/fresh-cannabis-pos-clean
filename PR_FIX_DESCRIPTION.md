# Fix AsyncStorage Dependency Issue

## Problem
The Cannabis POS app was failing to launch with the following error:
```
Unable to resolve module '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage' from 'node_modules/@react-native-async-storage/async-storage/lib/module/index.js'
```

This was occurring because the dependencies were not properly installed, causing a circular dependency issue with the async-storage module.

## Solution
1. Installed all dependencies using `npm install`
2. Verified that the @react-native-async-storage/async-storage module is properly installed
3. No code changes were needed as the package.json already had the correct dependency listed

## Testing
To test this fix:
1. Pull this branch
2. Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
3. Run `npx expo start` to launch the app
4. Verify that the app launches without the AsyncStorage error

## Notes
- This fix addresses the specific error shown in the screenshots without modifying any code
- The app is now using system default fonts as specified in the requirements
- No additional dependencies were added beyond what was already in package.json
