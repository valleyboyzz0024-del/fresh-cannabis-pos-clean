# Complete Font Audit and Fix for Cannabis POS App

## Problem
The app was still crashing with font-related errors:
- "Variant body small was not provided properly"
- Issues in text.tsx and dev.js
- React Native Paper Text components using variants that don't exist

## Complete Solution
This PR implements a comprehensive audit and fix that:

1. **Removed ALL variant definitions** from theme.js to prevent "variant not provided properly" errors
2. **Fixed ALL screen imports** to use Text from 'react-native' instead of 'react-native-paper'
3. **Enhanced font patching script** to patch multiple React Native Paper files
4. **Forces theme.fontVariant = 'regular'** throughout the app
5. **Uses only system fonts** with no complex font processing

## Changes Made
1. **src/theme/theme.js**: Completely removed variants section that was causing crashes
2. **All screen files**: Changed Text imports from 'react-native-paper' to 'react-native'
3. **fix-paper-theme.js**: Enhanced to patch Text.js, Provider.js, and fonts.js in React Native Paper
4. **App.js**: Forces theme.fontVariant = 'regular' right before rendering
5. **Created import fixing scripts**: fix-text-imports.js and fix-imports-clean.js
