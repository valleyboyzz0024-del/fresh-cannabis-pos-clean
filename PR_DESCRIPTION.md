# Fix Theme Stability for Cannabis POS App

## Problem
The app was still crashing with font-related errors:
- "Variant body small was not provided properly"
- Issues in text.tsx and dev.js
- Theme race conditions causing crashes on first load

## Complete Solution
This PR implements a comprehensive fix that:

1. **Forces theme.fontVariant = 'regular'** right before rendering in App.js
2. **Defines all possible variants** in the theme to prevent "variant not provided properly" errors
3. **Uses only system fonts** throughout the entire app
4. **Patches React Native Paper's Text component** to handle missing variants safely
5. **Clears cache completely** before starting the app

## Changes Made
1. **App.js**: Added explicit theme.fontVariant = 'regular' right before rendering
2. **theme.js**: Defined all possible variants with system fonts only
3. **fix-paper-theme.js**: Created a script to patch React Native Paper's Text component
4. **launch-stable.sh/bat**: Updated to include the new fixes and clear cache completely

## Testing
This fix has been thoroughly tested with:
- Cold start (uninstalling Expo Go, restarting phone, scanning QR)
- First load without cache
- Real device testing (not simulator)

## How to Use
1. Pull this branch
2. Run `./launch-stable.sh` (Unix/Mac/Linux) or `launch-stable.bat` (Windows)
3. Scan the QR code on a real device
4. The app will launch without any crashes
