# Fix React Native Deprecation Warnings

## Overview
This PR addresses several deprecation warnings that appear in the console when running the Fresh Cannabis POS application. These warnings don't prevent the app from functioning but should be fixed to ensure compatibility with future React Native versions and to maintain a clean development experience.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. `pointerEvents` Prop Deprecation
- Fixed the deprecated usage of `pointerEvents` as a direct prop
- Moved all `pointerEvents` values into the style object as per React Native recommendations

### 2. `shadow*` Style Props Deprecation
- Replaced deprecated shadow style props (`shadowColor`, `shadowOffset`, `shadowOpacity`, `shadowRadius`) with their box shadow equivalents
- This ensures compatibility with newer React Native versions that prefer the `boxShadow*` naming convention

### 3. `useNativeDriver` Animation Warning
- Added platform-specific handling for `useNativeDriver` in animations
- Made `useNativeDriver` conditional based on platform to prevent warnings on web
- Added necessary Platform imports where missing

## Implementation Details
- Created individual fix scripts for each type of warning
- Added a comprehensive script (`fix-all-deprecation-warnings.sh`) that runs all fixes in sequence
- Added documentation explaining the issues and fixes in `DEPRECATION_FIXES.md`
- Created a test script to verify that all issues have been addressed

## How to Test
1. Run the app before applying fixes to observe the warnings in the console
2. Apply the fixes by running `./fix-all-deprecation-warnings.sh`
3. Run the app again to verify that the warnings are gone
4. Run `node test-deprecation-fixes.js` to verify that all issues have been fixed

## Additional Notes
- These fixes are non-invasive and don't change the app's functionality
- For iOS native development, you'll need to reinstall pods after applying the fixes
- For Android, a clean rebuild is recommended after applying the fixes
