# React Native Deprecation Warnings Fixes

This document explains the fixes implemented to address the deprecation warnings in the Fresh Cannabis POS application.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. `pointerEvents` Prop Deprecation

**Warning:**
```
props.pointerEvents is deprecated. Use style.pointerEvents
```

**Fix:**
- Replaced direct `pointerEvents` props with `style.pointerEvents`
- Example:
  ```jsx
  // Before
  <View pointerEvents="none" />
  
  // After
  <View style={{pointerEvents: 'none'}} />
  ```

### 2. `shadow*` Style Props Deprecation

**Warning:**
```
"shadow*" style props are deprecated. Use "boxShadow".
```

**Fix:**
- Replaced all shadow style props with their box shadow equivalents:
  - `shadowColor` → `boxShadowColor`
  - `shadowOffset` → `boxShadowOffset`
  - `shadowOpacity` → `boxShadowOpacity`
  - `shadowRadius` → `boxShadowRadius`

### 3. `useNativeDriver` Animation Warning

**Warning:**
```
Animated: `useNativeDriver` is not supported because the native animated module is missing. Falling back to JS-based animation. To resolve this, add `RCTAnimation` module to this app, or remove `useNativeDriver`. Make sure to run `bundle exec pod install` first. Read more about autolinking: https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/autolinking.md
```

**Fix:**
- Added platform-specific `useNativeDriver` settings to all animations
- Made `useNativeDriver` conditional based on platform:
  ```jsx
  // Before
  Animated.timing(opacity, { toValue: 1, duration: 200, useNativeDriver: true })
  
  // After
  Animated.timing(opacity, { toValue: 1, duration: 200, useNativeDriver: Platform.OS !== 'web' })
  ```
- Added necessary Platform imports where missing

## How to Apply the Fixes

1. Run the comprehensive fix script:
   ```bash
   ./fix-all-deprecation-warnings.sh
   ```

2. For iOS native development, you'll need to reinstall pods:
   ```bash
   cd ios && bundle exec pod install
   ```

3. For Android, clean and rebuild:
   ```bash
   cd android && ./gradlew clean
   ```

## Additional Notes

- These fixes address the warnings but don't add the native animation module. For full native animation support on iOS/Android, you'll need to ensure RCTAnimation is properly linked.
- For web development, animations will continue to use JS-based animation which is appropriate for the web platform.
- The fixes maintain backward compatibility while eliminating the deprecation warnings.
